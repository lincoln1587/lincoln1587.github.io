excerpt: ' This paper focuses on resilient self-localization technology for UAVs, starting from the three core elements of perception, estimation and control in the self-localization system loop, emphasizing resilience indicators such as continuity, reliability, and adaptability. The paper reviews and evaluates domestic and foreign research work from the perspectives of redundant information fusion, robust pose estimation and resourceful treatments. The limitations of current UAV self-localization technology under resilience indicators are highlighted, and the technical difficulties of method integration under limited onboard resources are pointed out. Finally, development trends concerning UAV resilient self-localization technology are prospected.'

At present, research on self-localization technology for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is primarily focused on meeting the localization requirements for simple tasks in sparse and friendly environments, employing specific hardware configurations. However, these technologies lack continuity, high reliability, and strong adaptability in large-scale, complex, and dense environments or for long-term and challenging missions, which limits the wide-range and large-scale application of UAVs. This paper focuses on resilient self-localization technology for UAVs, starting from the three core elements of perception, estimation and control in the self-localization system loop, emphasizing resilience indicators such as continuity, reliability, and adaptability. The paper reviews and evaluates domestic and foreign research work from the perspectives of redundant information fusion, robust pose estimation and resourceful treatments. The limitations of current UAV self-localization technology under resilience indicators are highlighted, and the technical difficulties of method integration under limited onboard resources are pointed out. Finally, development trends concerning UAV resilient self-localization technology are prospected.
