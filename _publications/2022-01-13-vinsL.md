excerpt: 'We propose a navigation system combining sensor‐aided inertial navigation and prior‐map‐based localization to improve the stability and accuracy of robot localization in structure‐rich environments. Specifically, we adopt point, line, and plane features in the navigation system to enhance the feature richness in low‐texture environments and improve the localization reliability. We additionally integrate structure prior information of the environments to constrain the localization drifts and improve the accuracy.\[[Video](https://youtu.be/3oumqy65wMk)\]'

The article proposes a visual-inertial navigation method to support the autonomous operation of a quadrotor UAV during the building façade inspection tasks, where state-of-the-art vision-based localization methods may fail due to texture point feature insufficiency. Considering the appearance characteristics of the building façades, we additionally fuse line features and their corresponding structure prior information to the sliding-window-based estimator to improve localization reliability and accuracy. The contribution of the proposed method lies mainly in two aspects. First, we develop an informative feature selection mechanism according to the façade patterns and the inspection trajectory patterns to make a balance between localization accuracy and computation overheads. Second, we further utilize structure prior information, which is defined as line-to-line and point-to-line relationships, as another source of high-fidelity measurement to restrain the localization drifts. The proposed method is tested not only on public datasets, but also on an actual flight data package recorded in a building inspection task. Experimental results show that the proposed method can serve as a practical tool for navigating a robot in a building inspection task, with improved localization reliability and accuracy.
